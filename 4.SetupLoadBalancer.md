# Setup the load balancer

Run haproxy on two servers (master & a backup), use keepalived to provide a
virtual ip which is shared between the two servers

## Install software

Install haproxy and keepalived

$ sudo dnf install haproxy
$ sudo dnf install keepalive    

## Configure

1. On both of the load balancer nodes create the following directories
$ sudo mkdir /etc/haproxy /etc/keepalived

2. Then copy the following files in

haproxy.cfg -> /etc/haproxy/
check_apiserver.sh -> /etc/keepalived/

3. Pick one of the nodes as the master and copy

keepalive.master.conf -> /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf

4. On the remaining control nodes copy

keepalive.backup.conf -> /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf

5. Edit the keepalive.conf and check_apiserver.sh files and choose an virtual 
   IP for Haproxy. It's really important that the ip is on the same subnet as 
   the control plane nodes or they won't be able to see it

6. Change ownership of the config files to the system

```
$ sudo chown root:root /etc/keepalived/* /etc/haproxy/*
$ sudo chmod 644  /etc/haproxy/* /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
$ sudo chmod 744 /etc/keepalived/check_apiserver.sh
```

7. Turn off SELinux (Is there a way to avoid this step?)
$ sudo vi /etc/selinux/config
change enforcing to permissive

8. Next add magical system parameters
```
$ sudo vi /etc/sysctl.d/90-keepalived.conf
# Then add the following
net.ipv4.ip_forward       = 1
net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1
```

8. Open up the port we're using in the firewall and add a rule to allow the
   keep alive traffic to pass between the ha nodes

$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=6443/tcp
$ sudo firewall-cmd --add-rich-rule='rule protocol value="vrrp" accept' --permanent

9. Enable the services

$ sudo systemctl enable haproxy
$ sudo systemctl enable keepalived

10. Reboot
