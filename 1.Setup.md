# Setup base VM's

## Phase one in which Dorris sets up a VM

1. Downloaded fedora server iso
2. Start Hyper V manager and created 3 three vm's, two workers and master
each has 2gb memory 100gb hardrive and is gen2
3. edit settings for vm's and set cpu's to 2 and secure boot to microsoft uefi
   Certificate Authority. Depending on ho wmuch memory you have you may need to
   cap the dynamic memory to be able to start all the vms
4. Start vm and select start fedora
5. select install to harddrive, then english uk
6. Click on installation destination and accept default 
7. COnfirm the root user is disabled
8. Create a user e.g. name bob, pass kate
9. Begin install
10. Click Finish
11. Reboot
12. Start ssh
```
sudo systemctl enable sshd.service
sudo systemctl start sshd.service
sudo systemctl status sshd.service
```
13. Set hostname
```
hostnamectl set-hostname X
```
14. Reboot
15. Update packages
```
sudo dnf check-update
sudo dnf upgrade
sudo dnf autoremove
```
16. Reboot
17. Snapshot vm's

## Enable connections from WSL

Annoyingly this step is not persisted between reboots of the host so this needs
to be repeated. Adding shortcuts to your powershell $profile makes this easier

1. Start admin powershell
2. run 

```
Get-NetIPInterface | select ifIndex,InterfaceAlias,AddressFamily,ConnectionState,Forwarding | Sort-Object -Property IfIndex | Format-Table
```
3. Find id for the default and wsl switches then run
```
Set-NetIPInterface -ifindex <default switch id> -Forwarding Enabled
Set-NetIPInterface -ifindex <wsk switch id> -Forwarding Enabled
```
4. Profit
